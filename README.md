# SkyBrew
Simulates the Alchemy system of 'The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim' in Python. Work in Progress.


:gear: How to Use It:
- First, you need a way to edit and run Python (.py) files on your machine.
- Clone this repository.
- Run SkyBrew.py by pasting the following into Command Prompt:
    - cd Your\Directory\Here
    - SkyBrew.py


:heavy_check_mark: What it can do currently:
- Checks for valid combination of ingredients.
- Prints Potion Magnitude, Duration, and Gold Value of the potion's individual effects.
    - Also prints total Gold Value of the potion overall.
- Adjusts Potion Calculations based on Player's Alchemy Skill and Perks.
- Accounts for Fortify Restoration buffs if the user has any Fortify Alchemy Enchants.


:pencil: I am working on:
- Implementing a way to accurately distinguish a potion's primary effect from the side effects.
    - This matters when accounting for Perks such as Poisoner and Benefactor.
- Fixing the logic around how certain Perks are handled.
- Eventually implementing AE content. Currently, only ingredients and effects available in base Special Edition are implemented in my script.
- General Revisions and fixes.


Note: I am still very inexperienced at Python and coding in general, so I am open to feedback.
