    -Formula:
    Result = fAlchemyIngredientInitMult x BaseMag x SkillMult x Alchemist Perk[1.0 to 2.0] x Benefactor Perk[1.25] x Physician Perk[1.25] x Poisoner Perk[1.25] x Sum of Enchantments[1.0+] x Seeker of Shadows[1.1]
    fAlchemyIngredientInitMult: 4
    fAlchemySkillFactor: 1.5
    BaseMag: Alchemy effect base magnitude
    BaseMag = Effect Base Mag * Ingredient Mag Mult
    SkillMult: 1 + (fAlchemySkillFactor - 1) x Skill / 100
